  <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
  <p>This is my very first HTML web page and I'm excited to share what I'm learning.</p>

  <h2>About This Project</h2>
  <p>This project is part of my journey to becoming a skilled web developer. Here.</p>

  <h3>What I’ve Learned</h3>
  <p>So far, I’ve learned how to create headings, paragraphs, and even clickable images in HTML. These are fundamental building blocks of any website.</p>

  <p>I’m also learning how to use Git and GitHub to track and share my work with others.</p>
